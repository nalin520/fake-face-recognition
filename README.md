# fake-face-recognition

With the arrival of GANS, a lot of Fake Face images are being produced. This results in a threat of fake face id's on passports, id cards, etc. So, I have developed a Deep Learning model based on CNN layers that will identify the image as real or fake with 83% accuracy.
Here, I have used Convolutional Neural Netwrks with help of Pytorch.
